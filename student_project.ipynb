    "Brückner and Ciccone (2011) investigate how democratic change is triggered. This question has been posed by others before, and the literature investigating the relationship between income and democratization exhibits a key distinction: the causal effect emerges from either persistent or non-persistent shocks to income. Research on persistent changes in income tend to find a positive relationship between income and institutional development (e.g. Barro (1999) or Boix and Stokes (2003)). See also Brückner et al. (2012) for a study investigating the effect of persistent income shocks on scores aiming to measure institutional development. They employ an instrumental variable approach and find that the 2SLS estimator yields a positive effect of persistent positive income shocks on democratic improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper to be replicated in this notebook differs to other literature as it focuses on the effect of non-persistent shocks on income, and the authors contribute to the strain of literature arguing that transitory economic downswings can provoke leaps for democracy (as do e.g. Lipset (1959) or Haggard and Kaufman (1995)). For instance, Lipset (1959) claims that during recessions the legitimacy of authorian regimes is threatened, perhaps because people attest inability to the ruling government. However, Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) argue that democratic change may be triggered even if income shocks are known to be exogenous and temporary. Conceptually, Brückner and Ciccone (2011) are close to the theory of political transition developed by Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) where the latter argue that in times of recession the opportunity cost to contest power is temporarily reduced. Accordingly, autocratic regimes respond with improved democratic institutions when citizens repel policies which can be reversed once the opportunity cost of contesting power revisits non-recession levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brückner and Ciccone (2011) find that non-persistent negative shocks to income raise institutional scores in sub-Saharan African countries in the following year $-$ countries become less autocratic and more democratic. To overcome endogeneity and reverse causality issues an instrumental variable approach is taken, where rainfall serves as an instrument for income. The main result yields that in response to a temporary negative income shock of 1 percent the combined institutional score improved by 0.9 percentage points while the probability of a transition to democracy increases by 1.3 percentage points.\n",

    "Brückner and Ciccone claim that temporary negative shocks to income cause political institutions in sub-Saharan Africa to become more democratic. Accordingly, negative income shocks decrease the opportunity cost of contesting political power, and to retain stability and command the ruling regime will employ less autocratic institutions. The opportunity cost of protesting is inevitably unobservable but is claimed to covary with income. Since income per capita and institutions are likely to have unobserved common causes an instrumental variable approach is taken to isolate the exogenous variation in income. Further, many (e.g. Acemoglu et al. (2001), Barro (1999), or Acemoglu et al. (2002)) study the effect of institutions on income per capita. Despite much of this literature focuses on the long-run effects of institutions on income and Brückner and Ciccone investigate the effect of temporary income shocks on institutional outcomes there is still concern for reverse causality which would bias estimators of the causal effect. The instrument is rainfall which is assumed to cause variation in income per capita ($\\rightarrow$ IV is relevant), whereas is not correlated with the error term when regressing institutional scores on income and covariates (exogeneity assumption), and its only effect on institutions is through income (exclusive restriction assumption). Rainfall affects GDP per capita by increasing agricultural production, such that droughts will have a negative impact on GDP per capita. It is ruled out that droughts lead to an economic upswing (monotonicity assumption)."

The authors mention two potential channels. First, if road floodings vanish in aftermath of a drought, cost of transport and coordination of political protest would decrease. Second, Cekan (1993) finds evidence that young men are more likely to be sent to urban areas in times of drought which may decrease coordination cost. In these cases, it is still possible to assess the impact of rainfall shocks on polity scores but the interpretation of the causal effect of interest does not withstand. That is, it cannot be argued that improvements in polity scores are due to negative income shocks."

Certainly, the creation of four subsamples cuts down the numbers of observations and severe rainfall incidents which may lead to small sample bias but it may be that some important factors are missing. For instance, socities with a large agricultural sector tend to be poorer (e.g. Kuznets (1973) or Laitner (2000)) and as indicated by the sample correlation of -0.691 between agricultural GDP share and log income per capita. Accordingly, Panel I countries constitute the richest and Panel IV the poorest countries in the sample (see code cells following this paragraph). Thus, the chain of mediation seems to only be *active* for low to medium income countries (Panel III) while there is not such an effect for very poor and medium to high income countries (Panel IV and Panels II and I, respectively). The notion of low, medium and high income countries refers to the sample as from a global perspective most countries in the sample are low income countries. \n",

For Panel IV countries the link between protests and insititutional improvements seems to fail, and/or there exist barriers to contest power even in times when opportunity cost of protesting is reduced. Perhaps, a very poor farming population cannot afford to protest in times of droughts as they are constrained to focus attention on food and income provision. Or, very poor countries have less developed infrastructure and fewer means of transportation and communication to organize effective protests. There are likely other factors that can shed some light on this issue but are out of scope of this analyis."

    "\n",
    "What came up in the previous discussion about the instrument affecting the treatment and the causal link to the outcome can be related to the concept of the *Local Average Treatment Effect* (LATE) developed by Imbens and Angrist (1994). The LATE offers a more precise concept to understand what $-$ or, in fact, *who* $-$ drives the 2SLS estimation results, and for whom the causal effect is informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "As indicated by the preceding analysis the causal effect identified by this design is not informative for the entire set of countries, but rather for countries whose medium to large agricultural sector left incomes vulnerable to rainfall shocks (however, not for countries with very high agricultural GDP shares). These *compliers* are the set of countries that underwent treatment only due to the instrument's *push* into treatment, i.e. countries that witnessed an economic downturn in response to a negative rainfall shock. For the so-called *always-takers* who receive treatment in cases where the instrument does and does not influence treatment the LATE is uninformative. Therefore, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is different to the LATE since for the former both compliers and always-takers are considered. One can show that the ATT is a weighted-average of treatment effects of both compliers and always-takers, see Angrist and Pischke (2009). \n",
    "\n",
    "To recover the LATE a monotonicity assumption is required in addition to the conventional exogeneity, relevance and exclusive restriction assumptions described above. Monotonicity means in principle that the instrument's effect on the treatment variable must be either positive or negative for all units. In particular this does not allow the presence of *defiers* $-$ units that would receive treatment in the counterfactual state of an inactive instrument but do not if they are pushed intro treatment by the instrument. Here, this would be the case if countries which would have been falling into a recession do not do so in response to a drought. A potential case for defiant behavior is given if a country is to avoid a recession when a drought occurs because as a response to the drought the government engages in expansionary fiscal policy which averts the recession. Now consider the second group not receiving treatment: *never-takers* refer to objects not receiving treatment regardless of the instrument's value. Mapping this group to the underlying panel, countries with a neglectable agricultural share can be considered never-takers as they do not respond to rainfall shocks with a recession $-$ by definition, the LATE cannot be informative for this group."

    "**The Average Causal Response** $-$ *Generalizing the LATE*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since for the main analysis in section II GDP per capita as a continuous variable is the causal variable of interest the treatment intensity varies. This means, a similar-sized sudden and temporary decline in income does not have the same effect on institutional scores for different levels of initial income. The single coefficient reported in a linear causal model may lead the reader to believe that the treatment effect is constant for every initial level of income. However, Angrist and Imbens (1995) show that the 2SLS estimator is a weighted average of all unit causal responses, where the unit causal response is the average difference in potential outcomes of compliers at a given level of the treatment. In other words, the average effect on the outcome of countries moving from a certain intensity of treatment \"to a bit more\" due to the instrument's influence is the unit causal response. Averaging over the range of treatment intensity while weighting by the share of compliers along it, gives the *Average Causal Response* (ACR). As noted by Angrist and Pischke (2009) the idea of the ACR extends to continuous treatment, as is the case here. The 2SLS estimator obtained from regressing the change in the combined polity score on instrumented income (and controlling for time and country fixed effects) is the ACR, driven by compliant countries that are subject to variable treatment intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, the ACR involves weighting by the share of compliers along the range of treatment intensity. Accordingly, the weighting function allows to learn who drives the estimated causal effect. Following Angrist and Imbens (1995), one can consistently estimate the weighting function by computing the difference in cumulated density functions (CDF) of the treatment variable with the instrument turned on and off. Hence, the weighting function can be interpreted as the difference in probabilities that treatment intensity is at or below a given level conditional on the instrument kicking in or not. By monotonicity, this can only be positive as it is assumed that the effect of the instrument on treatment can either be positive or negative but never both. The ACR weighting function for the binary instrument $drought$ is depicted in *Figure 2* and yields for a given level of treatment intensity the relative share of compliers (Angrist and Pischke (2009))."

    "The relative size of compliant countries is largest for low to medium income countries (relative to the sample as most countries in the sample are low income countries, globally speaking). In other words, a negative rainfall shock affects GDP mostly for countries with a log per-capita income of around 6.2 to 7.3. Note that this finding is consistent with the evidence presented in *Table 5* where it is shown that the group of countries with a medium to high agricultural GDP share (Panel III) are driving the ACR. As claimed, these are the low to medium income countries which is also indicated by the ACR weighting function which depicts that most action indeed comes from this group of countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that by monotonicity the effect of a drought either affects income positively or negatively. However, for countries in the range of 6.2 to 7.3 log GDP per capita the relative share of compliers is positive while it is negative between 7.3 and 9.2. Consider *Figure 3* plotting the treatment intensity's CDFs conditional on the instrument's realization of unity or zero $-$ note that the ACR weighting function presented above is the difference between the CDFs. Under monotononicity it is required that the entire CDF of the treatment variable conditional on an *active* instrument is shifted to the left since a drought causes incomes to move to a lower income distribution. However, this is not true for the entire range of treatment intensity. The issue can be understood as follows, for a given probability of, say 0.85, treatment intensity (i.e. income) is higher if a drought occurs compared to if it does not. The monotonicity assumption is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate for speculation is again the differences in agricultural GDP shares since those are negatively correlated with income as argued above. For higher income countries $-$ again relative to sample $-$ agriculture is a smaller determinant of GDP per capita, and hence, rainfall shocks are affecting less people and are less severely transmitted to overall incomes. While this can explain what is driving the treatment effect, it remains unclear how the *negative relative size of compliers* comes about. Following this argument one would expect values of the ACR weighting funciton near zero for high treatment intensities, but not negative ones."

    "General elections of the state's representatives and the executive are major political events that can change the political equilibrium of represented interests. The opposition generally has an interest to convince voters to bring a breath of fresh air into politics and address people's preferences not served by the regime. In response to a shift in preferences not addressed by the policy of the regime in power, the latter may be incentiviced to adopt policies of newly formulated demands so to not lose legitamicy or the people's goodwill. To pin down this idea, consider this placative example: think of sub-Saharan farmers to protest for more constraints on the executive as they fear that their agricultural land will be sold to the regime leaders' good friends. They would not have protested if it was not during a drought since their costs to protest are low when income opportunites on the field are low. As the agricultural sector's GDP share is large, many work in agriculture and feel the same way. The opposition has an incentive to win over the farmers and pledge to change the constitution in favor of a more balanced executive. On the other hand, the regime in power may fear to be voted of out office $-$ or in a more autocratic setting: to face riots and disobedience $-$ and promises to constrain the chief executive. While the government's worry may exist during all protests, it seems reasonable to believe that the actual risk to lose power is larger during times of elections. Also, the opposition $-$ if there is any $-$ may gain more ground for their matters in times of election.\n",

Perhaps, the decision to protest in fact depends on whether there is an election or not, as the expected impact of protesting is larger shortly before an election when the threat to deselection is still credible. If one considers protests to be the country's treatment in times of reduced opportunity cost, then there may be selection into treatment based on whether an election held in that year.\n",
    "* An assumption made: it is ruled out that having an election is already an improvement in itself. That is, if a country never had elections, and suddenly introduces them, the combined polity score in the year of the first vote will likely improve due to the introduction of elections. Then, the improvement in polity scores cannot come through the election channel, and protests will directly improve polity scores in the first year of votings $-$ i.e. having a primal election is part of the outcome.

Following their identification strategy the causal effect of transitory negative income shocks on institutional improvement is recovered: A temporary negative shock to income of 1 percent amounts to an increase in the combined polity score of 0.9 percentage points while the probability of a transition to democracy increases by 1.3 percentage points. This is, however, not a constant causal effect which holds for every country. In section III the agricultural sector's vital role in recovering the causal effect and in the underlying research design in general is stressed. Further, the findings are critically assessed in light of the expositions on the LATE and ACR. It is shown, that the treatment effect is driven by low to medium income countries which are characterized by a medium to high agricultural GDP share. Richer countries showed a tendency of defiant behavior as indicated by the negative part of the ACR weighting function, and thus violating the ACR's monotonicity assumption. While countries with a low to medium treatment intensity (income) vis-à-vis medium to high agricultural GDP share were *pushed* into treatment, richer countries with fewer agriculture were not.\n",

Results indicate that an election increases the combined polity score by 6.75 percentage points while the effect of a one percent decline in income amounts to an increase of 0.85 percentage points. In times of an election the effect of a preceding income shock is more pronounced, suggesting that protests induced by a temporary decline in opportunity cost of contesting power are more effective in times of election. It seems that people demand institutional improvement following a rainfall-induced negative shock to income and regimes in power respond with a more democratic institutional setting. Brückner and Ciccone argue that transitory negative income shocks lower opportunity cost of contesting power and that protests in the aftermath open a *window of opportunity* for institutional improvement. In this notebook it is shown that this window opens for a subset of countries only. Presidential or parliamentary elections, however, open it a bit further.\n",

    "*Table 9* shows results of estimating log rainfall in $t$ on log rainfall in $t-1$ while controlling for country fixed effects (1) and additionally allowing for a country-specific time trend (2). The specifications rely on work by Ciccone (2013). Following Verbeek (2008), the investigated time series is mean-reverting as indicated by the point estimate being \"close\" to zero, i.e. rainfall does not persistently depend on past levels and shocks to rainfall die out quickly over time. Formally, testing for mean reversion based on a Dickey-Fuller test is required, which is not discussed here."
