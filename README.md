In this notebook the main results of the following paper are replicated: M. Br√ºckner and A. Ciccone (2011) "Rain and the Democratic Window of Opportunity", *Econometrica*, Vol. 79, pp. 923-947. The paper can be found [here]( https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA8183), the paper's data are available [here](https://www.econometricsociety.org/content/supplement-rain-and-democratic-window-opportunity-0), additional data on elections is taken from [here](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/continent-view/Africa/40).

The authors find that non-persistent negative shocks to income raise institutional scores in sub-Saharan African countries in the following year - countries become less autocratic and more democratic. To overcome endogeneity and reverse causality issues an instrumental variable approach is taken, where rainfall serves as an instrument for GDP per capita.

While the main results of the paper will be replicated, additional work focuses around 

* visualisation of the underlying story told, 
* the interpretation of results in light of the expositions on the *Local Average Treatment Effect* and *Average Causal Response*, and 
* an extension of the not-much discussed mechanism that relates temporary income shocks to improvements in institutional scores. For that, the role of presidential and parliamentary elections is investigated.

The notebook is work in progress. 

Please feel free to ask any question, or to comment on the work.
